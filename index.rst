The Go Programming Language: Tutorial
###################################################





Contents:

This tutorial approach to the Go programming language is higly personal: it handles the questions I ask myself when I study a new programming language. It works for me, let us hope it works for you as well.

The emphasis is not so much on syntax but on answering questions, big and small, which cross my mind when I am learning and - when left unanswered - prevent me to work well with the language.
